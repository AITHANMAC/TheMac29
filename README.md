In software design, communication is essential because it guarantees that developers, designers, project managers, and stakeholders all understand the same requirements, schedules, and design objectives. In the end, good communication helps to create a product that satisfies user goals and technical requirements by encouraging collaboration and minimizing misunderstandings. Clear communication, attentive listening, and frequent feedback are essential components of software design communication. By preventing unclear requirements, clear communication makes sure that everyone understands specifications in the same way. By ensuring that each team member's viewpoint is acknowledged and understood, active listening fosters a cooperative atmosphere. Teams are better able to promptly resolve problems, make the required corrections, and stay in sync when they receive regular feedback during the design and development process.

I once encountered a communication issue when working on a smaller task at work involving documentation. I misunderstood the initial guidelines and did not clarify them with the team, assuming I knew the format required. When my manager reviewed my work, I discovered I had documented it incorrectly, leading to additional revisions. Reflecting on this experience, I realize that asking a few clarifying questions and confirming my understanding early on could have saved time. With what I've learned, I would now prioritize seeking feedback sooner and double-checking the requirements to ensure my work aligns with team expectations, preventing similar issues in the future.

  One important design principle that I feel is very convenient for users is simplicity, meaning keepings things straightforward and accessible to use leading to a wide range of users. This helps users not to get confused as new apps and softwares can be hard to get used to.  In Design Assignment Two our software is a Tourist Itinerary Generator. Simplicity was our  goal, for example the app's map interface is similar to popular apps like Google Maps and Maps from Apple so users are somewhat familiar with the tools and options. In addition the app displayed simplicity in the drop down menus allowing users to open advanced settings options without leaving the main screen.  
Simplicity should be a priority in software design as it improves accessibility and overall better user satisfaction making  the application more approachable for users, even if they lack tech experience. Not only does simplicity help enhance user experience but a simple design makes it easier to troubleshoot, maintain and update the software benefiting the developers as it reduces errors as complexity often leads to mistakes. In conclusion the design principle “simplicity” leads to better usability, expands the range of users and makes development and maintenance more manageable.

The requirements gathering stage of software development is crucial because it involves working with stakeholders to define the specific requirements and project goals.
